# Presentations

This is a portfolio repo of presentation demonstrating work I have lead at Umuzi and the African Coding Network.

## Context
**Umuzi** is a South African NGO that supports young people to access digital skills learning to earning opportunities. Umuzi founded the **African Coding Network (ACN)** to partner with coding schools, tech platforms, employers, and funders to support young people across Africa to become economically active in the digital economy.

**Yoma** is a transformative digital platform that empowers young people across the globe to learn, earn, and create a positive impact in their communities. By connecting youth with tailored opportunities, skill-building resources, and a supportive network, Yoma fosters economic independence and active citizenship. Our unique approach, backed by partners like **UNICEF**, creates a dynamic ecosystem that aligns global and local objectives, ultimately driving sustainable change and equipping the next generation for success. Discover the Yoma difference and join us in shaping a brighter future for all.

## 1. Yoma's Digital Learning to Earning Pathways for UNICEF ESARO
As Yoma's digital skills partners, Umuzi and the African Coding Network have partnered with UNICEF country offices across Africa to develop scaleable learning to earning journeys to support young people to gain skills and become economically active. This includes delivering programmes in partnership with Grow with Google, Meta, and SAP.

## 2. Ke Ya Rona
I founded a vehicle financing business for Uber drives in Johannesburg in 2014. The model was based on rent-to-buy, filling a gap in the market for drivers who could not afford to buy their own vehicles, and didn't qualify for bank loans. I decided to close the business after a year as the volatility of driver income did not allow for smooth repayments.
